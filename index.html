      <h2>The Process</h2>
      <p>First I located the Drunken Pegnuins grades in the Penguins dataset. I then
      sorted the data in Excel so I had all the Quiz data together and all the Homework data together.
    After everything was sorted I created a Bin for each dataset by taking the max data value and
  finding the right number to divide it by in order to make the data presentable. Once I had my
scores and the Bins, I used a Data Analysis add-on called Analysis Tool-Pak to create these histograms.
It was extremely easy to input the data using the Analysis Tool-Pak because I could just highlight the data
that I needed depending on where I wanted it to appear on the x or y axis. </p>

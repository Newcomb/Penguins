      <h2>The Process</h2>
      <p>First I located the Drunken Pegnuins grades in the Penguins dataset. I then
      sorted the data in Excel so I had all the Quiz data together and all the Homework data together.
    After everything was sorted I created a Bin for each dataset by taking the max data value and
  finding the right number to divide it by in order to make the data presentable. Once I had my
scores and the Bins, I used a Data Analysis add-on called Analysis Tool-Pak to create these histograms.
It was extremely easy to input the data using the Analysis Tool-Pak because I could just highlight the data
that I needed depending on where I wanted it to appear on the x or y axis. </p>

      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>In Cairo's chapter 7 we are told that numbers can be decieving based on their proportional values and one of the best
      ways to see which value is better than another is to use statistical anaylsis. Even though the Bin values make the variation
    of the homework grades seem less than that of the quiz grades a closer look at the standard deviation of the homework category, 3.67, and of the
  quiz category, .89, might make you believe that the homework grades have much more variance from the mean. However, when we compare these numbers by dividing
them by the mean for their category we find that the difference for quiz grades is actually higher than that for homework grades, .129 vs .113. This is an example of why
going further to provide more complete data can influence the perception of your visualization.</p>
